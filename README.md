# Reversi
:wave: Hey, this repository contains the reversi python file with an built-in AI, which is based on an algorithm.

## Requirements
**Python:**
<br/>
I recommend using Version [3.7.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-376/) (the game was coded and tested in this version)
<br/>
You can also use the newest stable python release (no guarantee that it will work)
## Setting up
### Linux
### Getting sources & installing required modules
Firstly, clone this repository with all the assets and code:
```
git clone https://github.com/Plompii/Reversi.git
```
Now install the module `pygame`, the other modules used are already installed with Python's standard libary:
```
pip install pygame
```

### Using
```
