# Reversi
:wave: Hey, this repository contains the reversi python file with an built-in AI, which is based on an algorithm.
## Setting up
### Requirements
Python:
I recommend using Version [`3.7.6`][https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-376/] (the game was coded and tested in this version)
but you can also use the newest stable python release (no guarantee that it will work)


### Getting sources & installing required modules
Firstly, clone this repository, which includes the assets and code needed to run the game:
```
git clone https://github.com/Plompii/Reversi.git
```
Now install the module `pygame`, the other modules used are:
```
pip install pygame
pip install time
