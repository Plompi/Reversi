# Reversi
:wave: Hey, this repository contains the files to play my Reversi game, written in python with an built-in AI

### Requirements
**Python:**
<br/>
I recommend using Version [3.7.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-376/) (the game was coded and tested in this version)
<br/>
You can also use the newest stable python release (no guarantee that it will work)

## Setting up (.exe)
